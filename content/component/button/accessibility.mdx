### Important considerations

#### Maintain semantic consistency
<Row>
<Col>
    Do not use links instead of buttons. Buttons are intended for actions or operations (e.g., submitting forms, triggering actions), while links are intended for navigation to other pages or resources. Avoid using links for triggering actions, or buttons for navigation purposes.

### Keyboard navigation


### Labeling
<Row>
<Col>
    - Ensure buttons have discernible label text. If the button has no visible text, the label attribute must be used to provide an accessible label.
    - If there are multiple buttons with the same text, such as *Apply*, the label attribute can be used to give each button a distinct label, such as *Apply for A, Apply for B*, etc.
