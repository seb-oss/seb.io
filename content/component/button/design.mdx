## Design
Each button type has fully rounded corners. This creates a cohesive and consistent visual language within our design system. The differentiation in colour, border, and background helps users to easily distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary actions, contributing to a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Anatomy
A button consists of a container, a label, an optional leading or trailing element (icon). The anatomy of a button in our design system comprises various visual and functional elements that work together to create a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

    ### Trailing element

    Purpose

    Serves a similar purpose to a leading element but is positioned on the right side of the button.

    Attributes

## Leading/Trailing elements

<Row>
    <Col>An icon positioned at the beginning is known as a leading element, whereas the one at the end of the text is referred to as a trailing element. Both types of elements share common purposes, offering visual cues and improving the user interface. Nevertheless, their usage varies depending on the flow of content or the directionality of the interface.</Col>

</Row>

    <Col>
    
    ### Leading element
    
    Use leading elements to reinforce the button label's meaning. Some examples could be a trash can icon + label Delete, a search icon + label Search and arrow to bottom icon + label Download.
    
    </Col>
    <Col> <FigmaSVG node="1660-1893" caption="Leading elements that reinforce the button labelâ€™s meaning." /></Col>
</Row>


<Row>
    <Col>
    ### Trailing element
    
    Use trailing element as an affordance of what will happen when you interact with the button. For example, a button that leads the user forward in a flow, an arrow icon is a good choice.
    
    </Col>
    <Col> <FigmaSVG node="1660-1893" caption="The trailing element gives a hint on what is about to happen on click." /></Col>
</Row>
